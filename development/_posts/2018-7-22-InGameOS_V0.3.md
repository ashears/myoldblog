title: InGameOS V0.3
---

InGameOS V0.3 has been completed. 
This is an asset for the unity asset store that I am currently developing. The goal with this project is to allow game developers to put this asset into their game where it gives them  the ability implement interactive computers in their game world.

With V0.3, I added:
1. Basic Demo Scene. A character walks up to the computer, and is prompted to press a key to start the computer. On the key press the current version of inGameOS gets initialized.
2. Improved MinimizeManager script. This is the script that manages user programs opening and closing.
3. Implemented Sign Out ability
