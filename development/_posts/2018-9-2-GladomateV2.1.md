Updates:
1. I have added a new preset to the Gladomate automation program, called "Hasdrubal: Melee". <br>
2. Added functionality for units to move randomly around the enemy base, so that they are not simply sitting around once they reach the base.
3. Minor bug fixes to reduce possible errors.

Currently in the works for the Gladomate V2.2 update will feature presets for all the Greek Commander's in the game.
