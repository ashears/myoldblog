Today I released NeoAuto Version 1.0, my Neopets automation script. The bot is able to navigate the site and perform a variety of tasks. Users can select which task/s they would like the bot to do.

Available at: [NeoAuto V1.0](https://mega.nz/#!2OoS0CSS!0-owKDCgIUPNaD28F95rcmavfj4pf31JUPLu5kxbEzY)

Please read the README for instructions on how to use this program.
