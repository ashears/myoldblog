title: Gladomate V1.1
---

The first update for my Gladomate program was just released.
In this update, I added the ability to set custom ability rotations, which gives user's more control over the bots function. 
This increases the usability of the bot significantly. 

Available at: [Gladomate V1.1 ](https://mega.nz/#!jahylarS!PINiEcMc4-yBO2j73FIo7soJNUe0HrG7F9MEllslWIE)

Please read the README for instructions on how to use this program.
