With this update I have refactored the user interface for Gladomate, with the goal of being more streamlined. 
Now all user's need to do to use the program is to select which preconfigured setting they would like to use.

Additionally, I have been working on code for Gladomate to play as the Carthaginian Elephants. 
The initial concept of this is useable as one of the presets.

Available at: [Gladomate V2.0](https://mega.nz/#!GTxDzYyK!rJw1xV9n1juM0hNLz0MTplzI3SKZJBS21bQreQaKILo)

Please read the README for instructions on how to use this program.
