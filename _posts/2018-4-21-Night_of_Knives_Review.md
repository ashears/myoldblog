title: Night of Knives review
---

I recently read the book Night of Knives, by Ian C. Esslemont. After finishing it, 
it will have been my 16th book read in the Malazan Universe.
The 10 books in the Malazan book of the fallen series, two books from the Karkanas Trilogy, 
two books from the path to acendency series, and a book with three short stories of the characters Bauchelain and Korbal Broach.
I highly recommend all these books.

I found Night of Knives to be very high quality. Having already read two books of the Path to Ascendency series,
I enjoyed that characters from that series were in this one as well. 
The story takes place on the island of Malaz, under what is called a Shadow Moon. 
Legend has it that all many of foul monstronsities roam the streets during a Shadow Moon. Over the course of this one night, 
an Empress is crowned, a legendary soldier who was long thought dead is forced to return to the fold, 
and ancient powers team up to hold together the fate of the very realm.

Many details of the universe of explained in this book, 
but in the same manner as Steven Erikson, the author of the Malazan book of the Fallen series, 
some details are left unknown so as to leave some mystery.

I have immediately started the Return of the Crimson Guard storyline, which so far is superb. It includes Traveller, 
one of the most interesting characters in all the books.
