“When you do not recognize the wrongs of the past, the future takes its revenge. -Author forgotten”<br>
― Ian C. Esslemont, Stonewielder<br>

<br>
The story of Stonewielder takes place on the island of Korel. There, everyone worships “The Lady”, and other worship is outlawed. We find out early in the book that many years in the past The Lady created a wall, called the Stormwall, to keep out mythical aquatic beings called the Stormriders. These so called Stormriders are humanoid shaped beings that rise from the water, riding what looks like a mixture of a horse and a wave. <br>
<br>
In order to protect this wall, The Lady has blessed soldiers, called the Stormguard. While these Stormguard will always fight to the death to defend the wall, they also employ vast amount of slaves to defend the wall. Most slaves die against their first encounter with the riders.<br>
<br>
The main character of this book is Greymane, an infamous renegade ex-general of the Malazan Empire. Why do they call him Stonewielder? What does he have to do this the Stormwall? <br>
<br>
*SPOILERS AHEAD*:<br>
<br>
With the new Emperor on the throne, he doesn’t care for past grudges, and decides to re-enlist Greymane to his position of High Fist (term for military general of the Malazan Military), and send him back to his old mission, to conquer the lands of Korel. <br>
<br>
This past mission was where Greymane became cast out from the Malazan Empire. For some reason, he decided to speak to the Stormriders. Once Greymane reached a point on the Stormwall low to the water, the riders appeared the talk to him. From their perspective, they were the injured party. They believe that the wall keeps them away from their own lands. His goal was to stop the endless years of bloodshed to defend the wall.<br>
<br>
For approaching the Stormriders with the goal of peace, they gave him a gift. This gift was a large stone sword, and is infact where Greymane gets his name Stonewielder. We find out later in the book that the weapon channeled the warren of D’riss, the Warren of Earth. With this weapon Greymane had the power to reshape entire lands.<br>
<br>
Back to the current time of the story, the Malazan fleet is successfully able to invade Korel, and launches landing parties. The landing parties are split up to take out different primary strongholds of The Lady, supposedly where parts of her body lies. This should be a hint to those who have read other Malazan books, who else has their body parts scattered around? The Stormguard prove to be a brutal opponent, and many lives are lost. <br>
<br>
We find out near the end that the other landing parties were not the most important. Greymane, knowing his duty, tells the High Mage to travel him to the Stormwall through Warren. He does not tell anyone about this, because he knows that they would want to join him, and he did not think he would make it out alive.<br>
<br>
Upon reaching the location where they believe The Lady’s body is, they see an Armored Figure carrying a lockbox away through the Warren of Chaos, Skinner. Skinner is the new High King of the House of Chains, and this is when it becomes more obvious that The Lady is actually The Crippled God, the main antagonist of the story.<br>
<br>
The Crippled God was using the slaves brought to the wall as blood sacrifice. Their purpose wasn’t to defend the wall, as much as it was to give The Crippled God power. The Stormguard, in their zealotry, did not know that they were serving The Crippled God.<br>
<br>
Greymane knew that he had to make a choice. Destroy the stormwall, destroying an entire region from flooding, or let a tradition of bloodshed continue. He knows that he needs to correct the mistakes of the past, and destroy the Stormwall.<br>
<br>
Near the end of the book, Greymane plunges his sword into the Stormwall, causing it to come crashing down. With it, came a flood that destroyed much of the surrounding land. After all was finished, Sailors passing over the location where Greymane destroyed the wall noticed a giant armored man at the bottom of the water. One of them says to leave him, that he is the guardian who await’s the Lady’s return.
