title: Return of The Crimson Guard Review
---

Earlier this year I read the story "The Return of the Crimson Guard", by Ian C. Esslemont. This was another book set in the Malazan universe. One part that I greatly enjoyed was how it fleshed out certain mysterious characters from other books in the universe.

The story follows many perspectives, including members of the mercenary company The Crimson Guard, member's of the Malazan Empire, the occasional God, and more. The Crimson Guard have a sworn oath to destroy the Malazan Empire. The oath is so strong that the ones who originally swore it, called the Avowed, are near-immortal, and even upon death they remain till the Malazan Empire is destroyed.

SPOILERS:
There were three parts to this story that were my favorite. 
One was how Kyle, youth enlisted by the Crimson Guard and later framed for murder by Crimson Guard leadership, was carrying a tulwar (a type of curved sword) for most of the book that was literally one of the most powerful and mysterious gods in the entire series.
Another was when the Empress died. In the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, she comes across rather tyranical. She was undeniably brutal, and yet those who are next in line for power are certainly more evil.
The last event in the book that I particularly enjoyed was the Wickan horseriders charging into the warren of Chaos, and then coming out of it in a full-speed charge into the enemy flank.

Since reading this book, I started another fantasy series, Mistborn, By Brian Sanderson.
