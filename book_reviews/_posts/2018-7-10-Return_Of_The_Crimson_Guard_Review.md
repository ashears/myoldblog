title: Night of Knives Book Review
---

Earlier this year I read the story "The Return of the Crimson Guard", by Ian C. Esslemont. This was another book set in the Malazan universe. One part that 
I greatly enjoyed was how it fleshed out certain mysterious characters from other books in the universe.
SPOILERS:

One character that had some of their story uncovered was Traveller, who . There were three parts to this story that were my favorite. 
One was how Kyle, youth enlisted by the Crimson Guard and later framed for murder by Crimson Guard leadership, was carrying a tulwar (a type of curved sword) for most of the book that was literally one of the most powerful and mysterious gods in the entire series.
Another was when the Empress died. In the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, she comes across rather tyranical. She was undeniably brutal, and yet those who are next in line for power are certainly more evil.
The last event in the book that I particularly enjoyed was the Wicken horseriders charging into the warren of Chaos, and then coming out of it in a full-speed charge into the enemy flank.

Since reading this book, I started another fantasy series, Mistborn, By Brian Sanderson.
