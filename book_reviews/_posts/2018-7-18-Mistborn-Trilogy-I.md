The newest series I have been exploring is the *Mistborn* Series, written by Brian Sanderson.
After finishing the first trilogy in this series, I can safely say that Brian Sanderson now ranks among my favorite authors.
He is able to paint a picture of novel worlds filled with personable characters. 
The first trilogy in the Mistborn series has the books *The Final Empire*, *The Well of Ascension*, and *The Hero of Ages*.

At one point, a major character says, "There is always another secret". 
This truly embodies this first trilogy; by the end of the third book numerous mysteries all tie together in a satisfying way.
I think that may be why I like fantasy books. In real life, the human brain likes to find how things are intercorrelated.
Many things are quite interconnected in life, however I would argue that there is very rarely a strong connection, due to the numerous factors of life.
However, in a fantasy series, the author is able to set events up, withold certain information, so that by the end of the series everything is able to come together in a powerful way.

SPOILER WARNING:

One theme from this series that I would like to further explore is that of Balance. This embodies a way in which I regard the world.
It can be seen from the very beginning of the series with the fundamentals of allomancy - one of the types of magic in the series. 
Each allomatic metal has a counterpart that has an oppositve reaction. For example, burning pewter strengthens a user's resistance, while burning tin enhances their sensitivity.
The Gods of the world, Ruin and Preservation, also represent this balance.

In the end of the third book of the trilogy, Sazed takes both Ruin and Preservation's power. 
To save the world, it requires the ability to save, and to destroy. Creation lies in the balance of things.
Another way I would describe the balance between Ruin and Preservation's power is that of chaos and order. 
In my opinion, a person who devotes their entire being to order, or to chaos, 
will inevitable commit more attrocities than someone who can recognize the balance of all things. 
Yet, chaos and order together is the basis of all life in the known universe.

Humanity, understanding the balance, is able to stop the end of the world. I truly believe in this. 
We have the ability to solve problems, improve lives. All it takes is an open human mind, and the strength of animal willpower.
