  Hey there! Welcome to my blog :)
</p>
<p>
  
Out of anything in this life, I find that creation brings me the most satisfaction. 
 I use software development as a primary methodology for creation, as I believe that there are many practical applications to be built.  
<br>
<br>
I also enjoy reading, primarily fantasy books. Suggestions for new books to read are highly welcome.

If you would like to contact me, my current primary email is ashears@uoregon.edu.
